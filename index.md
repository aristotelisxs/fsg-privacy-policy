# Focus Session Guard Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-25

Focus Session Guard is a browser extension that helps users stay on-task during browsing sessions. This policy explains what data is processed, where it is stored, and how it is used.

## 1. What the extension does

The extension has a single purpose: compare each page you visit against your session purpose and show a focus alert when page relevance drops.

## 2. Data processed

The extension processes the following categories of data:

1. User-provided session purpose text.
2. Page analysis inputs from tabs where the extension runs:
- Page URL
- Page title
- Extracted on-page text/features used for similarity scoring
3. Analytics data generated by the extension:
- Similarity scores
- Alert/on-track outcomes
- Session metadata
- Recent page visit records
- Optional alert diagnostics metadata

## 3. Where data is stored

Data is stored locally in Chrome extension storage:

1. `chrome.storage.session`:
- Active window configuration (purpose, enabled state, silent mode)
- Per-window temporary stats
2. `chrome.storage.local`:
- Aggregated statistics
- Session history entries
- Recent page visit records (capped in code)

No custom remote analytics endpoint is used by this extension.

## 4. Network usage and third-party services

Release runtime configuration is set to `remote-download` model mode. The extension may download model assets over HTTPS from Hugging Face domains required for local inference setup.

Inference and page scoring still run locally in the extension after model assets are available.

The extension does not intentionally transmit your browsing analytics dataset to a developer-owned backend.

## 5. Data retention

1. Session storage data is temporary and tied to the browser session/window lifecycle.
2. Local statistics persist until:
- You reset statistics in the extension dashboard
- You remove the extension
3. Recent page visit history is capped by implementation to limit growth.

## 6. User controls

You can:

1. Set or update session purpose.
2. Enable/disable silent mode behavior.
3. Reset stored statistics from the dashboard.
4. Export stored analytics as CSV.
5. Keep optional alert diagnostics capture disabled (default) or enable it explicitly in the dashboard.

## 7. Permissions

The extension requests permissions required for core function:

1. `storage`: store session configuration and analytics locally.
2. `tabs` and `windows`: scope behavior per window and analyze active page context.
3. `offscreen`: run model inference support logic in an offscreen document.

## 8. Data sale or advertising use

The extension does not sell user data and does not use user data for advertising.

## 9. Changes to this policy

This policy may be updated as the extension evolves. Material changes should be reflected in the extension listing and release notes.
